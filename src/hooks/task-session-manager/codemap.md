# src/hooks/task-session-manager/

## Responsibility

Manages V2 background job-board state for task execution and injected completion messages, enabling the orchestrator to track active jobs and reuse only completed, reconciled child sessions by short aliases (e.g., `exp-1`, `ora-2`). The implementation is split into focused submodules to improve separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Design

The directory follows a **Facade + Strategy** pattern where `index.ts` acts as the facade that composes and orchestrates behavior across specialized strategy modules:

- **index.ts**: Main facade that wires hooks into OpenCode's lifecycle and coordinates between the job board, pending calls, task context tracking, and explicit user waits. Implements the plugin hook interface (`tool.execute.before`, `tool.execute.after`, `experimental.chat.messages.transform`, `event`) and exposes `beginUserWait()` to the `wait_for_user` tool.
- **stop-confirmation.ts**: Shared 5s grace for idle/absent runtime observations. Transient non-busy evidence stays provisional; confirmed durable stop evidence calls `markStopped` and can wake the parent. Busy/retry/live-busy reset the clock.
- **input-wait-tracker.ts**: Provides the single `hasInputWait()` seam used by idle reconciliation and continuation evaluation. It combines local question/permission waits with the process-global explicit user-wait latch.
- **continuation-attempt-gate.ts**: Owns process-global continuation epochs, reservations, and explicit user waits across hook recreation. The wait is encoded as an `attempts` sentinel so pre-upgrade #856 hooks sharing the store also fail closed. Distinct external user-message identity rearms both states.
- **continuation-model-selection.ts**: Normalizes current-session and chat-hook model shapes before forwarding runtime model and variant choices to idle continuation prompts.
- **pending-call-tracker.ts**: Tracks in-flight task calls using a capped ordered map (`MAX_PENDING_TASK_CALLS`) to correlate launch output safely. Provides call ID generation, storage, retrieval, and cleanup for pending task invocations.
- **task-context-tracker.ts**: Manages read context from child sessions with line-count and file caps. Stores context per task ID and provides pruning to prevent unbounded growth.

All modules depend on `BackgroundJobBoard` from `src/utils/background-job-board.ts` as the single source of truth for active jobs, terminal unreconciled jobs, reusable completed sessions, aliases, read context, and LRU caps.

### Key Abstractions

- **BackgroundJobBoard**: Central state store for task sessions (active, reusable, terminal unreconciled).
- **PendingTaskCall**: Tracks in-flight task invocations with call ID, parent session ID, agent type, label, and optional resumed task ID.
- **ContextFile**: Represents read context from child sessions with path, line numbers, and last-read timestamp.
- **User wait**: Explicit text-only HITL latch armed by `wait_for_user` and released by a distinct real external user message.

## Flow

### Task Execution Lifecycle

1. **Before Execution (`tool.execute.before`)**
   - Intercepts `task` tool calls on managed sessions
   - Generates a task label from `description`/`prompt` via `deriveTaskSessionLabel`
   - Creates a `PendingTaskCall` record with call ID, parent session ID, agent type, and label
   - Resolves reusable task IDs from the job board; completed/reconciled jobs
     are reusable by alias, while timed-out running jobs become recoverable
     only after a live busy signal confirms they are safe to resume
   - If no reusable task exists, allows fresh task creation
   - Refuses a brand-new spawn whose objective exactly matches an
     unreconciled terminal job from the same parent and agent (dispatch
     loop guard, #1070); a `task_result` retrieval after that job's
     completion (`lastUsedAt > completedAt`) authorizes the retry

2. **Task Launch (`tool.execute.after`)**
   - Registers task launches in the job board with task ID, parent session ID, agent type, and description
   - Parses task output to extract task ID, status, or launch information
   - Adds read context to the job board for completed or terminal unreconciled tasks
   - Handles late-cancelled tasks by normalizing output and updating state accordingly

3. **Context Tracking**
   - Extracts read files from `read` tool outputs using `extractReadFiles`
   - Stores context per task ID in the task context tracker
   - Prunes stale context during lifecycle events and status transitions

4. **Message Injection (`experimental.chat.messages.transform`)**
    - Injects a `<system-reminder>` part containing the `### Background Job Board` section into user messages for managed sessions
    - Lists active, unreconciled, and reusable sessions
    - Remembers injected terminal jobs to reconcile them on the next request after the completion was surfaced to the model (via `reconcileConsumedTerminalJobs`)
    - The idle timer remains a backstop for when the model ends its turn without further requests; after reconciling injected terminal results, the opt-in continuation evaluator can run in the same idle cycle under its existing guards

5. **Lifecycle Events (`event`)**
    - `session.created`: Adds new task IDs to pending managed set
    - `session.idle` / `session.status` (idle): Reconciles injected terminal jobs for the parent session (backstop path), then can run the opt-in continuation evaluator in the same idle cycle under its existing guards. Child idle is a stop candidate: the first observation stays provisional, and only a confirmed idle/absent after the 5s grace marks `stopped`
    - `session.status` (busy): Marks sessions as running from live session state and resets pending stop confirmation
    - `session.deleted`: Clears job state, child jobs, and pending call records for the session

6. **Human-in-the-loop Waits**
   - `wait_for_user` calls the facade's `beginUserWait()` only after tool validation
   - The shared latch cancels pending continuation timers/reservations
   - Foreground-fallback replay provenance and shared fallback teardown state preserve the latch across plugin-manager recreation
   - Idle continuation remains suppressed until a distinct real user message arrives

### Data & Control Flow

```
User task call → tool.execute.before → PendingTaskCall created → task ID resolved/reused
→ tool.execute.after → BackgroundJobBoard.registerLaunch() → context extracted/added
→ Message transform → BackgroundJobBoard.formatForPrompt() injected as a system-reminder message part
→ session.idle → reconcileInjectedTerminalJobs() → BackgroundJobBoard.markReconciled()
→ opt-in continuation evaluator (same idle cycle, existing guards)
```

## Integration

### Consumers

- **Main Plugin (`src/index.ts`)**: Wires the task session manager hook into OpenCode's lifecycle via `createTaskSessionManagerHook()`.

### Dependencies

- **BackgroundJobBoard** (`src/utils/background-job-board.ts`): Central state store for task sessions and context.
- **Task Output Parsing Utilities** (`src/utils/index.ts`): `parseTaskIdFromTaskOutput`, `parseTaskLaunchOutput`, `parseTaskStatusOutput`, `deriveTaskSessionLabel`.
- **Guards & Logger**: `isRecord` utility and `log` for diagnostics.

### Configuration & Caps

- `maxSessionsPerAgent`: Limits reusable sessions per agent type
- `readContextMinLines`: Minimum lines to include in read context
- `readContextMaxFiles`: Maximum files to include in read context
- `shouldManageSession`: Predicate to determine which sessions are managed by this hook

### Events & Hooks

- `tool.execute.before` / `tool.execute.after`: Intercept task tool calls and register launches/status
- `experimental.chat.messages.transform`: Inject background job board status into user messages
- `event`: Handle session lifecycle events (created, idle, busy, error, deleted)

## Module Decomposition Rationale

The original monolithic module was split to improve:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Pending calls, task context, and job board state are now distinct responsibilities.
- **Testability**: Each module can be tested in isolation with focused contracts.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one concern (e.g., context tracking) do not affect unrelated logic.
- **Scalability**: Capped data structures prevent unbounded memory growth.

Each submodule adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle** while collaborating through the facade to provide a cohesive user experience.
